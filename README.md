According to the "About Us" page...

<i>"The Usual Joints started on a Sunday afternoon in Salisbury, Maryland when a group of friends and soon-to-be friends left the Market Street Inn and headed around the corner to the now-defunct Escape Bar. Upon arrival, the group found Escape to be closing and the subsequent stop, Flavors (now MoJo's), closed all together. Suddenly, instead of exploring a night pregnant with enjoyment and opportunity, the revelers now faced the cold, black void of not knowing where to go and what to do. Some went to Break Time; most went home. One went to meet others at Specific Gravity; while enjoying his Lucky 7 Porter and incensed at what he felt was a waste (it had been a gorgeous day and it was a gorgeous night), the seeds for our first site, 'What's Up, Salisbury!', were planted!"</i>

This is all true. At the time, I was adapting an e-commerce site for a friend of mine, using ASP.NET web forms and Cristian Darie's awesome book, "Beginning ASP.NET E-Commerce in C#." While drinking my beer on that fateful day, I realized that I could apply the e-commerce model to a restaurant and entertainment guide, substituting departments; categories; and products, with cities; neighborhoods; and restaurants. It took seven months, but I was able to launch The Usual Joints in May of 2011. It was a popular site for a few years, but keeping it up-to-date took a lot of work, and I eventually stopped updating the site a couple of winters ago. However, completing this project taught me more about full stack development, as well as search-engine optimization (SEO) and analytics, than I could learn in any class. Therefore, I'm sharing the my code, from metadata to SQL queries, with you: Enjoy!

    <a name="1"></a><h2>Our Commitment To Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>
    <a name="2"></a><h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on The Usual Joints website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Address</li>
        <li>Email Address</li>
        <li>Phone Number</li>
        <li>Payment (e.g., Credit & Debit Card, etc.) Information</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="3"></a><h2>The Way We Use Information:</h2>
    <p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
    <p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
    <p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
    <p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
    <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
    <a name="4"></a><h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
    <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. In addition:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not use cookies for tracking purposes.</li>
        <li>We do not allow third party behavioral tracking</li>
        <li>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="5"></a><h2>Third Party Links</h2>
    <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
    <a name="6"></a><h2>Google</h2>
    <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. See more at <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en" title="Google" target="_blank">Google</a>. We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>
    <a name="7"></a><h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more at <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" title="CalOppa" target="_blank">CalOPPA</a>.</p>
    <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
        <li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page and users are able to change their personal information by emailing us or by calling us.</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="8"></a><h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h2>
    <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
    <a name="9"></a><h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
    <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur, we will notify the users via email within 7 business days and we will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days.</p>
    <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
    <a name="10"></a><h2>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h2>
    <p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.</p>
    <p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>

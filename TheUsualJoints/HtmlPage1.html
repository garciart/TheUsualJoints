    <p>I'd like to change my 2nd PEAKS, Fire and Emergency Services Management to:</p>
    <p>Fire and Emergency Services Management</p>
    <ul>
        <li>P - Analytical, technologically proficient and able to relate past events to current actions</li>
        <li>E - 20+ years of writing after-action reports in the military</li>
        <li>A<br />
            <ul>
                <li>S - In the Fire and Emergency Services field, history is important, not only to preserve the rich heritage and traditions of the fire service, but to pass on lessons learned from accidents and tragedy. One of my final assignments for my Fire Fighter I course in 2012 was to make a Line Of Duty Death (LODD) presentation to the class, detailing the circumstances in which a firefighter was killed or seriously injured. </li>
                <li>T - Our class was broken down into five groups. Each group would have a week to prepare their brief and present it to the rest of the class. I suggested we review the 2007 Charleston Super Sofa Store Fire. Nine firefighters died in this fire, and while fire departments around the world had analyzed this fire inside and out, no one had approached it from the point of view of the firefighters. This was the perspective we, as new firefighters, needed to concentrate on, instead of what the chiefs were doing. </li>
                <li>A - Unfortunately, I was the only one in my group who had ever been an instructor or used PowerPoint. I took the lead in setting up the presentation, using my experiences in the Marine Corps writing after-action reports for everything from patrols to amphibious assaults. I reviewed and analyzed all the available material and decided to focus on the timeline, combining each event listed in the 2009 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Investigation Report F2007-18, with the fire simulation shown in the 2010 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Study on Charleston Furniture Store. This way, I could ask the class what they thought the firefighters saw as the fire progressed, effectively placing them in the fire. I also asked what they would have done differently, such as watching their air, keeping in contact with the hose line and their buddy, etc., based on what we had learned so far. At the end, I summarized the event by tying in Salisbury's incident and tactical priorities to what had occurred in Charleston.</li>
                <li>R - Once I was done, the instructor stated that while he had his doubts as to whether we could add anything new to an event that had been covered so many times, this was one of the best presentations he had seen. We received a pass for the presentation and eventually became firefighters.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>K - Instruction techniques and Fire History</li>
        <li>S - Able to present material to large groups of people and able to use audio-visual equipment (e.g., PowerPoint, projectors, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have gone through everyone's posts looking for what to do myself, and I know a few of you are frustrated. Maybe this will help: ethnic diversity is based on origin, i.e., Hispanic vs Indo-Aryan. Cultural diversity is based on norms, traditions and beliefs, i.e., Puerto-Rican vs Mexican or Pakistani Muslim vs Indian Hindu. Even though the outcome says, "Demonstrate a comprehension of cultural diversity, human behavior, and the relationship between technology and society", I believe Professor May is asking for an example of GENERATIONAL diversity, i.e., Baby-Boomers vs Gen-Xers (UN, 2009) in relation to technology. For example, "While on liberty in Dubai, the senior ranks took the opportunity to call home using the Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) station in the fo'csle. However, many of the younger Marines and Sailors just bought temporary cell phones and SIM cards at the local mall to call do the same." Please look at the below reference for more details. Best of luck to everyone.</p>
